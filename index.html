    <h1>My Journey to Become a Data Scientist</h1>
<p1>Hi! Welcome to my webpage. I am Fahmina, in my <i>mid 30s</i>, a mom, an accounts officer by profession and I am in the path of changing my accounting career  to be a <b>Data Scientist</b>.</p1>
<br><br>
<p2>Coming from a <i>non-technical</i> background, I initially struggled to find out what I have to do to become a data scientist.
I watched many youtube videos, read several articles, <mark><em>but, I was still not sure where to start!</em> </mark>
I bumped into several Data Science bootcamps and university degrees, <mark><em>but, I did not have the means to bear the expenses.</em></mark> </p2> 
<br><br>  
<h2><p3> <i>I started writing here, to inspire people like me who is not sure where to and how to start their data science journey.</i></p3></h2>
 <p4>After several months of researching, I believe I am in a position, to share my insight and journey with you, in order to <ins><STRONG>motivate you</STRONG></ins>; to <ins><STRONG>guide you</STRONG></ins>.</p4>
 <BR><br>
 <h4><p5>I will post <mark>weekly journals</mark> to update you with my <b><i>progress</i></b> and how far I have come since I started my journey; also, what is my next step towards achieving my goal.</p5></h4>
 <br>
 <p6> We always here the success stories, but we do not see the process or struggle that one has to go through to achieve the success.</p6>
 <h3> In these blogs we will embark on our journey together towards our similar career goal of becoming a <em>Data Scientist / Data Analyst.</em></h3>
 <p7>So, if you are like me, trying to become a data scientist but not getting a sense of direction, then </p7>
